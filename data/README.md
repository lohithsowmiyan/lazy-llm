## Dataset category explanation

All of the available datasets in this repository are divided into three categories:

| Category | Explanation |
| --------- | ----------|
| A | The dataset is robust, with good signal variability (theres a lot of room for optimization) |
| B | The dataset is robust, with low signal variability (with very low number of evaluations using naive approaches we can reach an optimization ceiling) | 
| C | The dataset has low information content (random selection of 1 or 2 things will do as well as anything else) |
