# lazy-llm

what does the function smo does?
it actually takes 4 rows at the sort (rank them) this is marked as done
then recursively divide them into best and rest (sort the other rows based on these values (bayesian theoram))
then add best value of the sort to the done and resort them based on the distance to heaven.
do this process recursively until 30 times (the.Last - the.label)
